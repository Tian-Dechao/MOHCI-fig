It is important to note that the HIMs generally do not show Chip-seq peak enrichment even thought the proportion is higher than random cases.
One main reason is that HIMs have small number of genes (average 11).
Note that these HIMs do not show statistically significant enrichment in Chip-seq peaks because of small numbers (average 11) of genes in the HIMs (data not shown).
