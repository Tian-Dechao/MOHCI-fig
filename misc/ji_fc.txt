We found that the gene members undergo moderate change from one cell type to another, whereas the TF members change at a much higher rate.
The median of JI$_{gene}$ and JI$_{TF}$ are 0.096 and 0.017, respectively. 
JI$_{TF}$ is $\sim$10 times smaller than JI$_{gene}$ (Fig.~\ref{go}E)

We found that the gene members undergo moderate change from one cell type to another, whereas the TF members change at a much higher rate.
JI$_{gene}$ has a median of 0.096 and it is higher than expected JI$_{gene}$ between random gene sets that are selected while controlling the set size and chromosome number (median ratio=14.12, Fig.~\ref{go}E).
One the other hand, JI$_{TF}$ has a median of 0.017 and it is close to expected JI$_{TF}$ between random selected control TF sets ( median ratio=0.878, Fig.~\ref{go}E).

The log-transformed ratio of Jaccard index on the genes/TFs between paired HIMs from different cell types to the expected Jaccard index between random control sets. 


### JI >= 1/3
Note that JI$\ge$ 1/3 indicate that two equal-sized gene sets share at least half of their genes.
